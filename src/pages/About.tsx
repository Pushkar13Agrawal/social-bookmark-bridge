          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Our Mission</h2>
          <p>
            In today's digital landscape, we save content across multiple platforms - tweets on Twitter, posts on Facebook, 
            articles on LinkedIn, photos on Instagram, and videos on YouTube. Social Bookmark Bridge was created to solve 
            the fragmentation problem by bringing all your saved content into one beautiful, organized interface.
          </p>
          
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">How It Works</h2>
          <p>
            Our platform seamlessly connects with your social media accounts through secure API integrations. 
            Once connected, we automatically sync your bookmarks and saved items, organizing them in one 
            searchable, filterable interface. You can add tags, set reminders, and organize your content 
            the way that makes sense to you.
